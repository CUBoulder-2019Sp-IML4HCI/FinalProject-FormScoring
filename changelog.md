03-06-2019 Ian Wilkins: -Finish project proposal draft
                        
03-07-2019 Ian Wilkins: -Begin prototyping microbit chain.
                        -Create initial mircobit reciever (receive -> write to serial) hex
                        -Create initial microbit middle link (receive -> package -> send) hex
                        -Create initial microbit end link (send via radio) hex
                        -Create initial python OSC server
                                          
03-12-2019 Ian Wilkins: -Update microbit middle link (receive -> package -> send) hex
                      
03-13-2019 Ian Wilkins: -Add link to GitHub repo to project proposal
                        -Add acceptance criteria to project milestones in project proposal
                        -Make final revisions to project proposal and submit to Moodle
                        
03-14-2019 Ian Wilkins: -After meeting with Ben, I have been shown that a microbit chain is not going to be as feasible as 
                         2 microbits communicating independently with the receiver.
                        -Begin prototyping signal strength reading
                        -Begin new python OSC server to handle new message format.
                        
03-14-2019 Garrett Sippel:-Wrote ocs handler

03-17-2019 Ian Wilkins: -Create first working microbit 'a' and 'b' hex
                        -Update python OSC server to interpret messages from microbit 'a' and 'b'
                        
03-20-2019 Both:        -Created youtube video
